## What is This?
I'm a big fan of [The Modern Mann podcast](https://www.modernmann.co.uk/). On the [10/1 episode](https://www.modernmann.co.uk/new/pupila) Olly Mann asked if anyone could help map out all of the designated Mannbassadors. Thinking this would be a fun project, I volunteered.

## Technologies
This project was build using [Create React App](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/) and the awesome open source globe library [React-Globe](https://github.com/chrisrzhou/react-globe).
